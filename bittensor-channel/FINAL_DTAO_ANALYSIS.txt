2024-04      |        32 |        12 |      104 | 2.67

  Key concerns in 2024-04:
  - [striker8694] Not sure how you can tell how my arguments dont make sense
  - [striker8694] But if the argument is ‘i believe in free markets where manipulation is fine and dilution happens to every currency’ not sure how any of the arguments made against it can be meaningful
  - [striker8694] Thats unclear
  - [striker8694] Not sure how that works in practice if you dont simultaneously add liq when emitting based on pool value
  - [_jpmf_] not sure where that came from

  Key concerns in 2024-08:
  - [_jpmf_] I'm not sure what it is you're asking. There are currently no subnet tokens, only TAO, so I think what you're asking for is impossible. Unless I'm misunderstanding.
  - [_jpmf_] you were on the ban list (not sure why or by whom) but I revoked your ban there
  - [xenox11] is running the current testnet similar to this? I would like to participate not sure of the hardware and other requirements
  - [wejh] confused slightly here, there will be 7200*7 tao emitted on the testnet?

  Key concerns in 2025-04:

Will their emissions go through the roof, and how quickly? My understanding is

  Key concerns in 2025-07:
  - [mcjkula] burning miner incentives should also burn the rest of inflation, I don't understand why validation is still worth 100%, when the miner's don't produce anything (there is almost nothing to validate)

  Key concerns in 2025-10:
  - [ch3rnobog] I still don't understand the reasoning to go from a burn to a lock to register a subnet. We are going to see some whale games unfold in the coming months since there is no risk to their TAO to registe
  - [ch3rnobog] When dTAO launched subnet registration was a cost to owners not a lock. Which is why I don't understand why it reverted back to being a lock again.
  - [simioape] I get why you don't understand this tho
  - [p383_54249] how is this confusing
  - [superhappychris] if the problem we're talking about is "Dead subnets that have a non zero price and take up a large portion of dtao emissions because of the fat tail of the price distribution" as const put it, i don't

1. [2024-04] liquid7_i7j
   "If unlimited slots means unlimited subnets, as we are supposed to be informed about the activity of each to know if we want to allocate stake to them, it becomes increasingly more difficult with time to decide where to stake. Imagine hundreds of SNs and potential projects. Thats untrackable"

2. [2024-04] consttt
   "It really comes down the following. 
1. 50% of the stake weight in a subnet comes from global (i.e. people that are not invested in the ponzi)
2. This means 50% of the validator consensus comes from from global (i.e. people that are not invested in the ponzi)
3. This means 1) the owner cannot control which miners get the remaining 50% of inflation.
4. and 2) atleast 25% (dividends) becomes sell pressure from people not invested in the ponzi. 

In a normal token ponzi the supply is heavily reguat"

3. [2024-04] consttt
   "You're right. If very few people participate in the process then it makes it more and more difficult for us to avoid 51% attacks."

4. [2024-04] bmmur
   "any litepaper dtao upcoming update for non developer? very hard to understand honestly"

5. [2024-04] consttt
   "yes absolutely. These terms are both legally difficult and incorrect. You are performing a 'stake' operation with the added nature of that stake being that it can dynamically represent the originally staked TAO."

6. [2024-04] spacetime_tao
   "dtao is a great solution. we just need hands-on experience. the bit1 paper is very technical and conceptualizing it is difficult for most people"

7. [2024-05] consttt
   ">  Re difficulty of average user.
For most users they can  1) apply a very simple S&P style index strategy across subnets which works because of the price rebalancing. 2) Stay in the root network and simply choose where to unstake from (zero loss). In both cases this is a net positive for Bittensor because we are leaving emission determinations to power users. This is a good thing."

8. [2024-05] samwatanabe.
   "Isn't it just pools people buy and sell into. Why is this such a difficult thing to implement and it's taking so long. Right now there is very little incentive for subnets to do any substantial work.

Dtao will prompt value and work."

9. [2024-06] ashw_tao
   "This is not directly related to dao but its a question regarding Child hotkeys. 

Larger valis delegating their stake to multiple keys/valis on a subnet will positively scale the subnet validation process. That being said, I see a chicken-egg problem. Assuming we want proliferation of validators to provide work on specific subnets, they still need to have a certain threshold of TAO to receive responses from miner servers. How do smaller valis come up with this amount? Or how do they earn the sta"

11. [2024-08] ch3rnobog
   "I'm having difficult time understanding why the need for dTAO over fixing or changing the way emissions are allocated in the current environment. 

Does a decentralized ai marketplace need defi gamification? 

If subnet owners negatively impact their subnets emissions by taking profits or paying expenses, salaries etc. how are they incentivized to build? 

DTAO is certainly interesting and I see the appeal, but should it replace the current system or should it be its own platform? 

As a subnet "

12. [2024-09] fivebytes
   "this also means you constantly have to keep tabs on the performance of the subnet(s) you participate in and this can become overwhelming"

13. [2024-09] spacetime_tao
   "yeah this is a valid concern. if a subnet team just stops posting updates one day, and you're not looking at that subnet & stake regularly, then you might end up getting burned. but I guess it wouldn't be that difficult if there was some kind of tracker or portal that would update you if the tao value becomes lower than your initial amount staked, or increases by x%. something like that"

14. [2024-09] spacetime_tao
   "no, not exactly cloning the emissions. that would be up to the participants in the test. but SN8 would still be the proprietary trading network, SN9 would still be pretraining, etc.

and I think that at the end, the leaderboard should only be based on the swap value. so anything in the free balance isn't counted. everyone starts on root so this won't be an issue. 

and it's still technically possible to rug by unstaking dtao and staking tao into sn0. but I expect it to be a little bit more diffi"

   "Sorry, you made it too complicated. I still don't understand what you mean. I'm not sure if it's related to my question. I just want to know the issuance model of dtao. Similar to the instructions of tao, one is issued for each block and distributed to the subnet pool according to the weight. This is very simple and easy to understand, isn't it?"

17. [2025-01] spacetime_tao
   "when dTAO launches, it will launch at a specific block. to keep it simple, I'll just use block 0.

the new tao emissions rule: if the amount of tao staked to subnets (not including root) is less than the number of blocks produced since the launch of dTAO, then tao is emitted from the system. if this tao amount is greater than the block number however, then no tao is emitted.

every day, 7200 blocks are produced. if the first day goes by and there's 5000 tao total in the pools (from a mix of stak"

18. [2025-01] mcjkula
   "> This has a larger potential return but with the important added risk of losing your entire funds if you're the last one to unstake. Basically this turns staking into a kind of trading. You need to be actively involved or else you might suffer large losses. I find it unethical to call it staking for that reason alone, regardless of what securities commissions would think of this.

I've heard this critique many times, and it was shortly brought up here recently (https://discord.com/channels/7996"

19. [2025-01] .marsdeep
   "@consτ [τ, τ] , I don't think my suggested change would be difficult to implement. As you say you already do this for root. The only thing is that I think this should happen for subnets too since I it should be possible for a staker to show specific support for a subnet. I cannot do that when I stake to root. I also want to benefit if the subnet I'm staking too is doing better than others. I just think the exchange risk should not be for the staker, it should be for the miners/validators."

21. [2025-01] hamlet.001
   "Ah I see. Just skimmed over the whitepaper for dTAO. (Side note to authors: the paper is somewhat difficult to understand. It could be helpful to provide more context, clarify key concepts, and write things more formally including precise definitions for variables like \dot{\tau} instead of just "Coinbase injection". Mathematical notation should also be standardized [e.g. P is used for both liquidity pool while \bar{P}i^{price} is 30-day moving average price] and should be defined somewhere rath"

22. [2025-01] ch3rnobog
   "Definitely agree. It's a huge change for everyone for sure. It would be a difficult pill to swallow for subnet owners when they entered knowing they would get all their locked TAO back then to have to burn 100 TAO to take an existing subnet into a fundamentally new system."

But assuming it's 1000 ALPHA and not something owners can update, wouldn't it still be difficult for people to acquire that in the beginning considering there'd be many people trying to get into various subnets, which could result in alpha depleting, and therefore slippage hitting hard?

30. [2025-01] spacetime_tao
   "if the subnet wants funding, then they'll want people to buy the token, as that increases the price and emissions. the market is there to determine the price via staking & unstaking operations. and then the system works to stabilize the price, by adjusting the amount of alpha that flows into the pool.

it would be harder to attract funding if every alpha token went straight to the participants. you would have liquidity issues for each subnet pool. also, I think it would be easier for people to s"

   "People who stake to root are getting dividends from all subnets the validator is registered at, as the TAO staked to root is global.

Now subnets only earn dividends in ALPHA, so to get TAO you will need to unstake the amount of ALPHA that is for the root stakers, which will add ALPHA to each subnet's pool and remove TAO, this inbalance will cause the prices to decrease, and it happens constantly.

Over time the sell pressure will wear off, which was shown similarly in the chart shared in the NS"

1) innovation is not on hold currently. There are plenty of slots available to purchase in case teams want to innovate and build. 

2) Look at 90% of the subnet charts - it continuously bleeds with low staking activity . A move (slowly but surely) from root to subnets is required. So root proportion must come down to also naturally push stakers to make that move and reward builders and teams.

   "While I agree with some aspects of what he's saying, I don't think validators need to give 100% back to delegates to be a good validator.
